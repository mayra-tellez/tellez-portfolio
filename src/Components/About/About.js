          Nothing makes me happier than coding a solution and doing it well. As a recent graduate of Austin Coding Academy and their  internship program, I've learned there are endless possibilites to finding an answer, and that's what makes it so exciting.

          I found my way to web development through some small exposure during my time in the fashion, retail and customer service industries. At Stitch Fix, I awed at the projects the engineers worked on. In my following roles at Beautifully Loved and Wildflowers Boutique, I created and updated websites first-hand. Now, I'm developing sites and apps from scratch for the people around me, and the best part of it all is that I'm helping to make a difference with work I enjoy.
