          *This website is admiringly inspired by the portfolio of <a href="https://fossheim.io/">Sarah L. Fossheim</a>. &mdash; Although I'm interested in learning, I'm not a UX/UI Designer by trade. So when it came to my personal portfolio, I decided to showcase my skills in mockup-to-reality creation instead. I found a site that I felt was relevant to my experience and personality and used it as a wireframe for my own site, only making adjustments due to content. Please enjoy and as always, feedback is appreciated!
